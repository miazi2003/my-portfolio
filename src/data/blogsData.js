      "How I planned, designed, and developed PHEDU Consult—an appointment booking platform with a modern UI and a scalable backend.",
    content: [
      "PHEDU Consult is a full-stack appointment and booking platform built to solve real scheduling problems. The main goal was to create a smooth user experience while keeping the backend secure and scalable.",
      "On the frontend, I used React and Tailwind CSS to build a clean, responsive interface. Firebase authentication helps users sign in securely and manage their sessions with minimal friction.",
      "On the backend, I used Node.js and Express.js to build REST APIs and MongoDB (Mongoose) to design structured schemas for appointments, users, and booking data. This approach keeps the data model flexible and maintainable.",
      "Finally, I deployed the frontend on Netlify and the backend on Vercel. This project improved my understanding of full-stack architecture, authentication, API design, deployment, and building production-ready workflows.",

      "Why I built Message Checker and how it helps freelancers write professional, risk-free client messages.",
    content: [
      "Freelancers often lose opportunities because of unclear, overly casual, or risky communication. I built Message Checker to help freelancers send confident messages that sound professional and client-friendly.",
      "The product idea is simple: paste a draft message, get quick feedback, and improve the tone before sending it. A clean UI was important, so users can focus on writing instead of distractions.",
      "I built it with React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript—keeping it fast, lightweight, and easy to use. This project taught me that small tools can create big value when they solve a specific pain point.",
      "Message Checker reflects my focus on practical products: simple features, strong usability, and clear outcomes for users.",

      "GrapeTask is a modern task management app designed to make daily workflow easier. The focus was clean UI, smooth interaction, and a structure that can scale with more features later.",
      "I used React and Tailwind CSS on the frontend to create a consistent layout and components. The backend uses Node.js and MongoDB to store tasks and user-related data.",
      "This project improved my skills in organizing UI states, planning data models, and building reusable components that keep the codebase maintainable.",
      "GrapeTask represents my interest in productivity products—tools that feel simple to use, but are thoughtfully engineered underneath.",
